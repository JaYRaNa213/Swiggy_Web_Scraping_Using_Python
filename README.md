# _Steps involved in process:_

## 1. Web Scrapping ‚õèÔ∏è
Given the dynamic nature of Swiggy's content, a traditional iteration over pages was not possible. Instead, automation was utilized to scroll continuously through the website, retrieving data as it dynamically loaded.By leveraging webdriver and selenium, the automation script was designed to mimic user behavior, scrolling down the Swiggy website to capture the dynamically loaded content. This approach allowed the extraction of data beyond what was initially visible on the screen. As the script scrolled down, it effectively retrieved the data, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Following is he code for website automation:

## 2. Data Cleaning üßπ

In the data cleaning phase, Power Query was utilized to refine the extracted dataset from Swiggy, ensuring its accuracy and consistency for further analysis. Several key cleaning processes were implemented:

1. Cleaning Duplicate Data:
    Duplicate records within the dataset were identified and eliminated using Power Query. Removing duplicates ensured that each entry was unique, preventing any distortions in the analysis due to redundant information.

2. Correcting Location Spelling:
    Inconsistent or misspelled location data was rectified using Power Query transformations. Standardizing the location names not only enhanced the dataset's readability but also facilitated accurate geographical analysis, enabling precise insights into regional trends.

3. Removing Null Values:
    Null or missing values in the dataset were identified and removed to enhance data completeness. Power Query allowed for the easy identification and filtering out of these null values, ensuring that the dataset was comprehensive and reliable for subsequent analysis.
